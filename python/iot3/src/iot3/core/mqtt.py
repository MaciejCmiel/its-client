        Create an MQTT client

        :param client_id: The MQTT client ID to identify as.
        :param host: The host name (or IP) of the MQTT broker.
        :param port: The port the MQTT broker listens on.
        :param websocket_path: The path of the websocket the broker is
                               reachable at.
        :param socket_path: The path of the UNIX socket.
        :param tls: Whether to use TLS or not. See below for details.
        :param username: The username to authenticate against the MQTT broker.
        :param password: The password to authenticate against the MQTT broker.
        :param msg_cb: The function to call when a message is received from
                       the MQTT broker.
        :param msg_cb_data: Arbitrary data that will be passed back to the
                            msg_cb function.
        :param span_ctx_cb: The function to obtain a context manager for an
                            OpenTelemetry span.

        There are two ways to connect to the MQTT broker:
         * via TCP: both host and port must be specified;
         * via websockets: all of host, port, and websocket_path must
           be specified;
         * via UNIX socket (only for local broker): socket_path must
           be specified.

        If socket_path is specified, then a connection through the UNIX
        socket is used; if websocket_path is specified, then a websocket
        connection is used; otherwise a TCP connection is used.

        If tls is not specified, then a heuristic will be made: if the
        port is the default well-known clear port, (1883 for MQTT over
        TCP, 80 for MQTT over WebSockets), then the connection will be
        attempted without TLS, i.e. in clear; for any other port, TLS is
        used and there is no fallback to connecting in clear. If tls is
        specified and is None, then the same heuristic is used as if it
        were not specified; if it is False, then no TLS is used for the
        connection; if it is True, TLS is used for the connection. Using
        TLS requires that the certificate of the authority that signed
        the server certificate, be present in the system certificate
        store (e.g. ca-certificates from Mozilla). TLS is never
        attempted over UNIX socket.

        Specifying a message callback as msg_cb allows subscribing to,
        and thus receiving messages from specific topics. If no msg_cb
        is provided, it is not possible to subscribe, and only emitting
        is permitted. msg_cb must be a callable that accepts at least
        those keyword arguments: data, topic, payload, retain. Ideally,
        to be future-proof, it should be declared with:
            def my_cb(
                *_args,
                data: Any,
                topic: str,
                payload: bytes,
                retain: bool,
                **_kwargs,
            ) -> None

        If msg_cb_data is specified, it is passed as the data keyword
        argument of msg_cb, otherwise None is passed.
